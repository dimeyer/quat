<h2>
<a NAME="a21"></a>2.1 Mathematical basis of fractal calculation</h2>
Essential part of the calculation of fractals is a formula to iterate.
(There are other types of fractals, but this is the one most commonly used).
"To iterate" means that the value, which resulted from the formula, is
feeded in it again the next step, and so forth. Such a step is called an
iteration. The point, which is to be calculated, is used as starting value.

<p>A point in this context is a complex number (in case of a two-dimensional
fractal). A complex number consist of two components, which are independent
of each other. They are called real and imaginary part. If the imaginary
part is zero, the complex numbers are identical to the real numbers (e.g.
1.23324, -23, ...). To mark the imaginary part, the letter "i" is used.
There is one rule: i*i=-1. (This fact shows, that "i" can't be a real number,
because no real number multiplied with itself is -1.) In general a complex
number "c" is written like this: c = a + i*b, where "a" is the real part
and "b" is the imaginary part (both a and b are real numbers). In two-dimensional
fractal programs the real part is identified with the X coordinate on the
screen, the imaginary part with the Y coordinate.

<p>Quat needs numbers which have one component more to calculate its fractals.
This component is necessary for the Z coordinate. Such numbers don't exist,
but there are numbers with four components: the Hamiltonian quaternions
(sometimes also called "hypercomplex numbers"). They consist of one real
part and three imaginary parts. The "signs" for these parts are
<b>1</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>j</b> and <b>k</b>. "1" corresponds to the real part,
"i" to the imaginary part of the complex numbers. In case j- and
k-part are zero, we again have the good old complex numbers. There are
special multiplication rules for 1, i, j and k. (These rules reveal a difference
between quaternions and hypercomplex numbers, but it isn't of any importance
for this section. Quat uses quaternions, but for simplicity I'll use both
names exchangeable.)

<p>Four components would allow even four-dimensional fractals, but for
practical reasons (see above) and the limitations of human mind (_not_
the programmer's incapacity...), Quat is "only" able to render three-dimensional
fractals. The additional fourth dimension (fourth component) is set to
a constant value, which is defined by the parameter
<i><a href="quat-us-4.html#a41lvalue">4th-dim.&nbsp;Intersection</a></i>
in the Object Editor. This proceeding
produces a three-dimensional intersection of a four-dimensional fractal
analogous to the two-dimensional intersection of the three-dimensional
fractals calculated by Quat which is made by common fractal programs.

<p>Back to our iteration formula. Quat uses one of the following formulas
(among others):
<nobr>x<sub>n+1</sub> = x<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> - c</nobr> or
<nobr>x<sub>n+1</sub> = c*x<sub>n</sub>*(1-x<sub>n</sub>)</nobr><br>
x<sub>0</sub> is the starting-value ( = point that has to be calculated)<br>
"n" is a count index which numbers the "x" (n=0,1,2,3...).<br>
The value "c" in the formula is a hypercomplex number, that remains
constant during the whole calculation. This is defined in the Object Editor
as parameter <i><a href="quat-us-4.html#a41c">c</a></i>.
<i>c</i>determines the shape of the fractal.

<p>One could see that the sequence of all x<sub>n</sub> defined by the
iteration formula (also called "orbit") can show three different schemes:

<ol>
<li>the sequence converges toward a fixed value (e.g. zero)</li>
<li>it oscillates periodically between some values</li>
<li>it gets bigger and bigger and this way goes toward infinity.</li>
</ol>

The object drawn by Quat is the amount of all points ( = numbers) x<sub>0</sub>,
for which the sequence defined by the formula doesn't go toward infinity.
(In other words: which doesn't show scheme 1. or 2.).

<p>This formulation isn't completely exact: there is the problem that a
computer can't do the calculation up to infinity to see whether the sequence
converges or not. (The reason is the limitation of human life, again not
incapacity of the programmer :-) ). Because of this the calculation is
stopped after a previously defined number of iterations. This number is
set in the Object Editor through the parameter
<i><a href="quat-us-4.html#a41maxiter">Max.&nbsp;Iteration</a></i> (simply called
<i>maxiter</i> in the following)

<p>But how does Quat know whether the sequence goes
to infinity or not? Thus there is the value
<i><a href="quat-us-4.html#a41bailout">Bailout</a></i>
(naming freely after "Fractint"). If this value was exceeded during the
iterations, it is assumed that the sequence goes towards infinity.

<p>Now we are able to describe the calculated object exactly: It is the
amount of all points ( = numbers) x<sub>0</sub>, for which the sequence
defined by the iteration formula of the x<sub>n</sub> didn't exceed the
value <i>bailout</i> after at most <i>maxiter</i> iterations. (How complicated nice
shapes are described mathematically... On the other hand: How nice mathematics
can be!)

<p>But to calm you down a little bit: those who don't understand all this
or who simply are not interested in it can, nevertheless, calculate nice
pictures.

<h2>
<a NAME="a22"></a>2.2 Coordinate systems and defintion of the view plane</h2>
What we have up to now is an object in Quaternion-Space (Q-Space). What
we don't have is someone, who looks at this object. That means: we have
to project the object onto the screen. Therefore we have to define a view
window on a view plane in Q-Space, which represents the screen. The way
the object is seen by the view plane is the way it is displayed on the
screen.

<p>As a result we have two different coordinate systems: First, the system
that has to be displayed (the Q-Space), second, the system on which is
projected (view plane, monitor).

<p>The Q-Space is defined by three axes, called 1, i and j, analogous to
the components of hypercomplex numbers (the k-part is set to a constant
value, see above). The 1-axis is the real axis ("ray of numbers"), the
plane defined by 1- and i-axis is the complex plane, in which 2D fractal
programs calculate their fractals.

<p>On the view plane there are two axes of the view coordinate system,
called X and Y axis, which correspond to the horizontal and vertical direction
of the monitor. Additional there is a Z axis, which points perpendiculary
away from the view plane and into the direction of the fractal.

<p>Regarding the fact that fractal objects are always around the origin
of the Q-Space, the following way to construct the view plane seems obvious.
There is a point in Q-Space defined, the
<i><a href="quat-us-4.html#a41viewpoint">View&nbsp;Point</a></i>.
The view plane goes through the <i>view point</i> and is perpendicular
on the vector from the origin to <i>view point</i>. (<i>view point</i> has a double
meaning: it defines position and orientation of the view plane). The <i>view
point</i> defines the Z axis of the view coordinate system. Henceforth we will
move only on the so defined view plane.

<p>Now there has to be taken a rectangular window on the view plane (=
the view window), which is oriented in the way that two opposite lines
of the rectangle are parallel to the projection of the
<i><a href="quat-us-4.html#a41up">Up&nbsp;(Orientation)</a></i> vector
(see later) on the view plane. The direction of this projection
is called Y direction and corresponds to the vertical direction on the
monitor. The horizontal direction is called X direction and corresponds
to the two other lines of the rectangle. As we see, <i>up</i> defines
where is up. Accordingly the directions of X and Y axis have been defined
through this.

<p>The diagonals of the view window/rectangle intersect in the <i>view point</i>
(This means that the <i>view point</i> lies in the "middle" of the screen/view
window). Now the view window is scaled around the <i>view point</i> as follows:
the side which is the X direction gets the length
<i><a href="quat-us-4.html#a41lxr">Length&nbsp;of&nbsp;View&nbsp;Plane's&nbsp;X-Axis</a></i>
(measured in Q-Space, often simply called <i>lxr</i>.)
and the relation between the lengths
X and Y gets the same value as the relation between the X and Y resolutions
(see parameters for <i><a href="quat-us-4.html#a44resolution">Image&nbsp;resolution</a></i>
in the "Other Editor"). This is to achieve
display without distortment. The base vectors of the view window (derived
from X and Y directions) get the length 1. Now we are ready. The view coordinate
system is defined completely.

<p>To get all possible positions of the view window (up to now every describable
plane is oriented around the origin), the view plane is shifted in X and
Y direction to the amount of the values given through the parameters
<i><a href="quat-us-4.html#a41move">Move</a></i> in the View Editor.
(it's a movement in the view plane's own coordinate system).

<h2>
<a NAME="a23"></a>2.3 ZBuffers</h2>
This new feature of Quat 0.92 makes it possible to split the calculation
into two parts: into the slow fractal <b>calculation</b> and the relatively
fast <b>display</b> of the image. To do this, Quat generates a so-called
ZBuffer, in which the shape of the object (as seen from the viewpoint) is
stored.

<p>Having created a ZBuffer, you can still change certain parameters (light
source, palette, color formula, Phong highlight and ambient light) and
generate an image from the ZBuffer, which works relatively fast.

<center>
<p><img SRC="chart_us.png" NOSAVE BORDER=2 height=235 width=608>
<br>Chart 1: Different ways to an image</center>

<p>ZBuffers open a wide field of experimentation, you can find out the
best look of the object by trying some different looks.<br>
ZBuffers have the suffix "ZPN". The full set of parameters is stored
in it, as well as in images (PNG). ZBuffers are quite usual PNG files,
but they don't contain an image. Some graphics programs even recognize
them and display them very easily when they are opened, some other need
the suffix to be changed to "PNG". I don't know if it makes sense to directly
view ZBuffers, because one can't do anything with the data stored therein.
